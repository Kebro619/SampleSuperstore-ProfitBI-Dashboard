# SampleSuperstore-ProfitBI-Dashboard
I developed a Power BI profit report for a sample superstore, featuring pie diagrams, line charts, KPI indicators, and column charts. The report analyzes profit margins by product category and region and includes a filter option for selecting states. An interactive and visually engaging tool for informed decision-making.
